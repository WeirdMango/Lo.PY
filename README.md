# Lo.PY
A project started by mangoess in attempts to make a terminal converter, to music, to lofi!

# LEGACY
This project is under The Unlicense so this is all public domain! except I wouldn't recommend you to download it until it's done.

# GOAL
LO.PY's goal is simple, make a terminal application that you can add a music file on, and it returns you a fitted Lofi remix version

# HOW
How will I achieve this goal, well currently with delay from other matters This project will stay online for a couple months and then archived and filtered out to the public domain.

Where is Lo.PY now? Currently I'm working on another project, fruity.py (See it in my profile!), and I'm resolving errors there!
