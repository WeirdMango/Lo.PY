# Lo.PY
A project started by mangoess in attempts to make a terminal converter, to music, to lofi!

# LEGACY
This project is under The Unlicense so this is all public domain! except I wouldn't recommend you to download it until it's done.

# GOAL
LO.PY's goal is simple, make a terminal application that you can add a music file on, and it returns you a fitted Lofi remix version

# HOW
How will I achieve this goal, well currently with delay from other matters This project will stay online for a couple months and then archived and filtered out to the public domain.
