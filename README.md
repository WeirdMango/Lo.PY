# WHY IM NOT WORKING ON LO.PY

You may see that there is no code here, this is because im focusing on my other projects and I'm still running my own tests of how select python modules work with audio.
Although I haven't completely given up, it might be a few till you see something up here

# Lo.PY
A project started by mangoess in attempts to make a terminal converter, to music, to lofi!

# LEGACY
This project is under The Unlicense so this is all public domain! except I wouldn't recommend you to download it until it's done.

# GOAL
LO.PY's goal is simple, make a terminal application that you can add a music file on, and it returns you a fitted Lofi remix version

# HOW
How will I achieve this goal, well currently with delay from other matters This project will stay online for a couple months and then archived and filtered out to the public domain.
