# Lo.PY
A project started by WeirdMango in attempts to make a simple terminal converter, to music, to lofi!

# LEGACY
Mango Cares extremely about legacy, when this project has been completed it is planned to be under the unlicense, allowing any type of work done to it.
Currently mango does not allow public use without authorization (submit an issue or msg mango on discord at mango#6205)

# GOAL
LO.PY's goal is simple, make a terminal application that you can add a music file on, and it returns you a fitted Lofi remix version
This plan may change but this is the plan for now
